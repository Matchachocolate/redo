​​Sally Ride is the first American woman in space. She completed the two missions of her astronaut career, broke the doubts about female astronauts, and won countless honors. After Sally Ride received a bachelor’s degree in physics and in English from Stanford University, she defeated thousands of applicants and was selected as NASA's 8th group of astronauts in 1978.

Sally Ride became the first woman to operate a space shuttle robotic arm.

In an interview before the launch of the Challenger, Ride was asked a series of questions: Do you plan to have children, and will you wear makeup in space? Or how would menstruation be handled in space? She was the third woman in space after cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Svetlana Savitskaya, there is still society's suspicion of women.
