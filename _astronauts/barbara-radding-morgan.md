Barbara Radding Morgan started off her career as a math and language teacher in 1974 before becoming an astronaut. When President Ronald Reagan announced a teacher would be sent to space, she applied immediately and was selected out of more than 10,000 applicants. Morgan trained as a backup alongside astronaut Christa McAuliffe, in preparation for the STS 51-L Challenger mission. On January 28th 1986, the Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff and seven crew members lost their lives. Morgan shared in an interview with NASA:

<div class="quotes">
“Christa was, is, and always will be our ‘Teacher in Space,’ our first teacher to fly.”

Following the Challenger accident, Barbara Morgan took on the duties for the “Teacher in Space” and was made NASA’s first Educator Astronaut in 1998. She flew into space as a mission specialist aboard Endeavour in 2007. Morgan reflected on the similarities between astronauts and teachers:

<div class="quotes">
“Astronauts and teachers learn and share; they explore; they discover; and then they go learn and share some more. And that’s what this is all about.”
</div>

Morgan claimed it was her hope that young people could see an “ordinary person” doing something extraordinary in space. She adds:

<div class="quotes">
“It’s all about learning and exploring, and we want them to come with us.”
