A childhood dream to be an astronaut was realized when Dr. Roberta Bondar launched from Earth in January 1992 aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery as the first neurologist in space and Canada's first female astronaut. Representing the international scientific community, she conducted over forty advanced experiments for fourteen nations.
Back on Earth, Dr. Bondar and her team of researchers examined data obtained from astronauts on 24 space missions to better understand the mechanisms underlying the body's ability to recover from exposure to space.
