On 18th May 1991, 27-year-old Dr. Helen Sharman became the first British astronaut in space and the first woman to visit the Mir space station. The story of Helen becoming an astronaut is very interesting. It all starts with a radio advert. In 1987, Helen, who graduated from the University of Sheffield, was a food chemist at Mars Wrigley Confectionery. One day, Helen heard a job advertisement for Project June on the radio saying, "astronaut Applications:  no experience necessary", she immediately applied and was selected from 13,000 applicants. In the interview, Helen stated that 

<div class="quotes">
“it wasn't so much going to space as the training that appealed [...] living in Russia, learning the language, doing advanced mechanics. It was a way out [of] the rat race."

Helen was sent to the Russian Astronaut Training Center for 18 months of training. There, she underwent the same intensity of training as a male astronaut. Moreover,  the astronaut suits in training were too big for Helen. So, Helen got a custom Sokol (Falcon)star suit. She said:

"Perhaps the greatest discomfort I suffered was doing tests in an off-the-shelf spacesuit, which was suited to fit a man.”

The Soyuz spacecraft was launched on May 18, 1991. On the day of the launch, Helen carried a photo of the British queen, a butterfly brooch her father gave her, and a "space passport". In space, Helen conducted various experiments in medicine, agriculture, biology, etc. She also used the amateur Radio chat with British school children. In addition, she brought some seeds into space for experiments to study the effects of space travel on seeds. Helen holds a special place in British spaceflight history.
