CSamantha Christopheretti was the first female astronaut in Italy. She set a record for a European woman to perform a single mission in space. She spent all her time on the International Space Station and was awarded the Medal of Merit of the Republic of Italy. She enjoyed learning foreign languages and was passionate about the humanities. In the aerospace industry where most of them are men, Gender is an inescapable issue, but Samantha Christopheretti's excellence is still obvious to all.

<div class="quotes">
" When it comes to NASA, you hear a lot that we haven’t reached gender balance ...So many women have been to space compared to so many more men, but you’re putting together all of history and all those decades in which women were either not there or a very small minority. It’s a little bit unfair to hold us accountable for decades in the past."
