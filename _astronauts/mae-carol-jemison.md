In 1992, US astronaut, doctor and engineer Mae Carol Jemison became the first African-American woman to go to space aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor on a mission named STS-47. Jemison was born in 1956 as the youngest of three children in Alabama and moved to Chicago at the age of three. As a big Star Trek fan growing up, she aspired to go into space and had no doubt she would achieve that big goal one day. In a 2007 interview, Jemison said:


<div class="quotes">
“As a little girl… I always assumed I would go into space. [...] Let me make sure that’s clear: I just always assumed, despite the fact that the US hadn’t sent any women up there, or people of color, that I was going to go.”

Little did she know that she would one day become the first real astronaut that starred in an episode of Star Trek. At the age of 16, Jemison received a scholarship from Stanford University and started studying chemical engineering and African and African-American studies. After graduation, she got a medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in New York in 1981. She later worked as a general practitioner, spending several years in the Peace Corps in West Africa. 

Mae Carol Jemison today is a science ambassador and makes an effort to democratize access to technology for the future of humanity. She told Stanford Today in an interview in 1996:

<div class="quotes">
“I think it’s so vitally important that all people in this world are involved in the process of discovery.”
