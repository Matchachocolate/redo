Eileen Collins has become a pioneer in the world of aviation as she was the first woman to command a space shuttle mission. From a very young age, she wanted to become a pilot. Collins earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and economics in 1978. Shortly afterwards, she enrolled in the pilot training course at Oklahoma’s Vance Air Force Base as one of the first women to be included at the base. In 1979, she completed the course and stayed on at Vance for three years as an instructor.


After many years of NASA training, Eileen Collins became the first female astronaut to pilot a space shuttle mission in 1995. One year later, she gave birth to a daughter, with her husband Pat Youngs who served as an Air Force pilot for Delta Airlines. In 1997, Collins piloted her second mission on the shuttle Atlantis, during its delivery of 7,000 pounds of equipment to Mir.


She had logged 419 hours in space by the time she was chosen by NASA to become its first female shuttle commander. 


Collins retired from the Air Force in 2005 and one year later from NASA. Since then, she has received many honors and awards, including induction into the National Women’s Hall of Fame as well as the Encyclopedia Britannica’s list of 300 Women Who Changed the World.
