Yi So-yeon is a Korean scientist and astronaut. Yi, 41, was the first and only Korean to fly in space. In 2006, YI studied for a Ph.D. at KAIST. At the same time, Yi defeated 36,000 applicants who were selected by the South Korean Space Program to receive training in Russia. The South Korean government paid Russia $20 million to allow Yi to accompany Russia's space flight. This is a "national pride" from South Korea and Yi.

“It’s a great honor to be the first and only astronaut of South Korea, but at the same time I’m kind of alone,” she said. “I have a huge responsibility, and much more eyes watching me is sometimes hard to handle.”

On April 8, 2008, Yi So-yeon as payload specialist with two Russian astronauts took off on the Russian Soyuz from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Yi conducted experiments and medical tests on the International Space Station for 9 days. She spent a total of 261 hours in space. During the flight, Yi was impressed by the beauty of the universe. 

<div class="quotes">
“Our beautiful planet, Earth, is the greatest gift from God,” she said. “I believe that we have an obligation to share it fairly with everyone, to preserve it to the best of our ability, and to hand it over to the next generation in as good a condition as when received.”
