        <h1>How to become a female astronaut at NASA</h1>        
            <br>
            Astronaut requirements have changed with NASA's goals and missions. Today, to be considered for an astronaut position, applicants must meet the following qualifications:
            <ol>
                <li>Be a <strong>U.S. citizen</strong></li>
                <li>Get the <strong>right degrees</strong>: Possess a master's degree in a STEM field, including engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science or mathematics, from an accredited institution.</li>
                <li>Have <strong>great eyesight</strong>: Just like pilots, having 20/20 vision is a prerequisite to being an astronaut.</li>
                <li><strong>Handle the pressure</strong>: All astronaut candidates need to pass a physical before being accepted into the program.</li>
                    <div class="quotes">
                        Astronauts are expected to be relatively fit in order to withstand high and low barometric pressure situations. NASA requires aspiring astronauts to have a blood pressure reading of about 140/90 at sitting position.
                    </div>
                <li><strong>Be tall</strong>: To be a commander or pilot astronaut, you need to be 158 to 190cm tall, NASA says.</li>
                    <div class="quotes">                    
                        To be a mission specialist, however, there is a little more leeway--“between 58.5 and 76 inches” which is 149 to 193cm.
                    </div>
                <li>Have at least <strong>two years of related professional experience</strong> obtained after degree completion or at least <strong>1,000 hours pilot-in-command time</strong> on jet aircraft.</li>
                <li>Be able to <strong>pass the NASA long-duration flight</strong> astronaut physical.</li>
                <li>There are <strong>many other skills</strong> that can be an asset to selection, such as scuba diving, wilderness experience, leadership experience and facility with other languages (especially Russian, which all astronauts are required to learn today.)</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

        <h2>Surprising facts about becoming an astronaut</h2>
            <ul>    
                <li>There are <strong>no age requirements</strong> for being an astronaut. The typical age range spans 26 to 46-years-old.</li>
                <li>There is also <strong>no specific body type required</strong> to be an astronaut, but you do have to fit in the spacesuit—called the extravehicular mobility unit—that the astronauts wear to do spacewalks. This may sound obvious, but spacesuits have historically been designed for men.</li>
                <li>There is a myth that a <strong>tattoo</strong> would prevent you from becoming an astronaut. This is not at all true. In fact, some Apollo astronauts were given tattoos– small dots to show where defibrillator pads should be placed in case of a medical emergency. </li>
                <li>In 2013, 6,000 people applied to become astronauts; NASA selected eight. And when a whopping 18,300 people applied for the class of 2017, only 12 were accepted — that's an <strong>acceptance rate of less than 1%</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
