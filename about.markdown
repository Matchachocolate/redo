        “A bird cannot fly with one wing only. Human space flight cannot develop any further without the active participation of women.”      - Valentina Tereshkova, first woman in space (1963)

    Humans have been flying in space since 1961, with the first women launching off planet Earth in 1963. Since then, women have gone on to set records for spacewalks and long-duration spaceflight on the International Space Station, with NASA aiming to land the first woman on the moon by 2024 under the Artemis program, named for the twin sister of Apollo. To date, women make up just over 10 percent of human space travelers.

    The near future looks bright for aspiring women space travelers of the world. Anna Kikina from Russia is scheduled to go into orbit in 2022. NASA has said it wants to land the first woman on the surface of the Earth’s Moon in 2024. Last week, the United Arab Emirates announced that Nora Al Matrooshi would become the Arab world’s first woman astronaut.
